# 🚀 Personal Portfolio – Internship Project @ Scalesix

Welcome! This is a cosmic x retro-themed personal portfolio built as part of my internship assignment at **Scalesix**. 🌌✨

## 🌟 About the Project

During my internship at Scalesix, I was given a challenge to create my own **Personal Portfolio Website** from scratch. I’m extremely excited to have had the chance to apply everything I’ve learned—from layout to responsive design, animations, and aesthetic styling.



## 💫 Project Theme

The design blends a **cosmic space vibe** with **retro-futuristic aesthetics** to reflect:
- My passion for design + code 🧠🎨
- A unique, creative expression of personal branding 👾🛸
- An interactive and responsive UI



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS** (Custom responsive layout)
- **Netlify** for deployment
